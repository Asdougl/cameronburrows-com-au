summary: 'A little roadmap of what I need to add to my blog'

## Todo

1. Add a little "about me" blurb to the bottom of each blog post
2. Add a all blog posts page, maybe make the category pages feel like a filtered list?
3. More intuitive experience for the back buttons on the blog pages
4. Add blog preview images
5. Reduce code duplication across blog pages
6. Make a nice blogpost REST API
7. Better (faster) search functionality **DONE** -- load all into frontend at build time, will need to be smarter when there's more blog posts but for now this will be fine
8. 3 related blog posts below post
