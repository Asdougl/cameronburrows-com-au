`DRAFT -- make more argumentative`

Bringing a large 2000mAh powerbank on a trip is an essential must-brink in my opinion and heres why:

## 1. Don't lose your charger

By bringing a large powerbank you can charge it in the day (if it even needs charging) either in an open and visible spot in an Airbnb or hotel room or a secluded spot for hostels. This means at night when your phone needs charging, you need to find your powerbank and can put away the relevant charger, ready for when you move to your next location. When you charge your phone next to your bed you may need to plug it into an outlet that is hidden, increasing your chance of unplugging your phone and forgetting the charger.

## 2. Charge where it's convenient

I found in hostels, less so in hotels, it was incredibly convenient to have my phone charging in a spot where there is no power outlet. For example a power outlet may be on the other side of the room. So charing at night with your powerbank means you can keep your phone with you when sleeping.

## 3. Travelling

The more obvious use case for a powerbank is on trains, planes and busses between destinations. On long trips you'll need something to keep your devices alive and your powerbank that you keep perpetually topped up is ideal. Whilst some trains and planes can have usb ports for charging, this risks you leaving a cable behind or having to unplug everything in a panic when your stop arrives.
